The following summarizes the report yielded by the repgrids. The survey was conducted with 6 cars on 10 different attributes. Clustering process resulted in the following inferencees. HondaAccord and NissanRogue were clustered together, but it could fall into different classification categotries. But the consistent clustering of Chrysler300 and DodgeAvenger is apparent as they are Diesel cars falling under common category. ToyotaHighlander being the only Big Sized Car, resulted in it always being clustered by itself, so this is as expected.But the behaviour of ChevroletCamaro and NissanRogue not being clustered together, with ChevroletCamaro consistently being clustered by itself. Since both of these cars are similar in the sense that they belong to the category of Winter Tires, but NissanRogue was clustered with HondaAccord. The cause for this would appear to be the scoring of attributes outside of the genre. Attributes such as whether the car is semi-automatic or self-driving  resulted in NissanRogue and HondaAccord being clustered together instead of NissanRogue and ChevroletCamaro. The other major reason we may have seen these results is because we may simply have just chosen people that have different perspectives. The results would have yielded differently with a different set of poeople

As for the attribute synonyms, we got more varying results between people. The only consistent result we had was that the attribute sets AllSeasonTires:WinterTires and All-WheelDrive:Four-WheelDrive resulted in them being synonyms. Besides the other attributes in synonym with the other is B-SegementCar:C-SegmentCar and CewCabCar:QuadCabCar which is expected. In conclusion, these were the results obtained from the trials conducted.
